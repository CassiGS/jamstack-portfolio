description: Notes on redesigning and redesigning again.
---

Hello and welcome. If you're here, you've found my little corner of the internet. Grab your travel towel: https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Towel and stay a while.

As someone who works on the Internet(TM), the classic advice is to always be working on a side project. I don't always follow that advice. Partly it's because I believe in brain cross-training of sorts (That's science, probably. You could google it, probably), and I think there is value in having non-work-focused side projects and hobbies. But that's a post for the other day.

But the other reason is scope creep.

Turns out I'm a terrible project manager and I'm not great at stopping the client (myself) from pitching wildly ambitious projects far outside the scope of the original project.

Like say a personal website. I've got a few ideas on things I want to add to this site and how I want to revamp it, but I also know none of those things will ever get done if I scrap it all continuously to redesign it again for the 1,000th time, only to let scope creep happen again, get overwhelmed and abandoned the project together.

So if you too are a recovering perfectionist who is trying to remind themselves to take baby steps, enjoy progress over perfection, and all that good stuff - well, know that you are not alone.

## V1

To help with the scope of a very very basic v1 of the project. My name! Literally I could handle just a name, right? So that's what I did. Design up a basic homepage with a cute tag line. Done.

From there I knew I wanted to start out with the site on Gatsby. I do that for my day job but I've never actually set it up from scratch. Could be a good thing to learn. I used the Gatsby starter blog just get some basic structure in place.

(P.S This is very obvious if you visit my GitHub page. That READMe is on my todo list)

For the hosting/site I tried to get the page set up through Github pages, but I found it more tedious than I wanted for a static built site, so I went what I know. And what Gatsby knows. I used Netlify. https://www.netlify.com/

## V2-ish

The blog for the Gatsby starter blog uses markup, so I am sticking with that for now (again, keeping things easy right?). At some point I might switch to contentful for this part, only because I'm lazy and I'm faster with a rich text editor than I am with markdown. But that might be down the road.

I things up with some basic tags, but they don't do anything yet. At some point I'll get those to point to relevant posts.

V3-ish and beyond

The future is unlimited, Glinda https://64.media.tumblr.com/da01c67403778f79745deae9ea25db27/b9328374e39cdbb9-70/s540x810/c070b487c738833188e203b778971324a439be92.gifv In the immediate future is more blog build out. A projects section. Maybe a redesign homepage. But for now, a basic b website and some scope creep tamed. For today.
