Hello, welcome. redesigned this website. It's probably, like, bad for business or something.

Thing is, I'm the kind of person that covets progress over perfection and yet will still find themselves poking around pixels back and forth for hours. Isn't that just how it goes?

### Redesign, part 1, 2, 3

At any rate, that has turned into me designing this website, redesigning this website, declaring it's too complicated and using a Gatsby template, before going back to redesigning it...again more times than I can count. I'd post my other design ideas here - but I might want to use them down the line, ya know? All I wanted was a little space on the internet to put some lil' projects (ok, there's just one and it's this one) and write some lil' blog posts (ok, there's just one and it's this one).

At some point I have grand aspirations to use this space for play - redesigning my home page like [lynnandtonic.com](https://lynnandtonic.com/) or building out some information architecture in the form of a digital garden like [maggieappleton.com](https://maggieappleton.com/).

But practically won out in at least starting somewhere (progress over perfection! It's happening!). So here we are. Dear reader, you may find that this is the only blog post on here for a while. But hey, it's pretty lightweight and it's built in Gatsby - so that's fun!
