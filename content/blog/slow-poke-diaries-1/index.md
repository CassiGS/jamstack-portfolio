Sign up for a spring run they said. It'd be fun they said\*.

\*(No one signed up for any of those things).

I signed up for the Vancouver Half Marathon this spring. Being someone in north Washington state, getting up to Vancouver is easy and pretty enjoyable. Much of the run is through the beautiful Stanley park. It sounded like a great time.

Until you realize you're training in the winter.

This will officially be my fourth half marathon, which is an odd thing for me to tell people because I feel like it marks me as A Runner. And I don't necessarily feel like A Runner. It's not imposer syndrome (well at least mostly), but I feel like my status as A Runner is a balance of tensions.

I'm not the fastest runner, and while I don't think speed makes a runner, I'm pretty slow for even most slow running standards. While again, I think this is an absolutely ok thing and people should find ways to move in ways that bring them joy, that said, even after 4 half marathons I still average a 12-15 min mile.

I both love and loath running. I love getting outside, I love getting in some movement, I'm always (mostly) happy when I get out for a run. But I also have a hard time motivating myself without external motivators.

I am both an indoor and an outdoor kid. I will happily go on a hike and happily stay on the couch all day to watch a Lord of the Rings Marathon.

I think a lot about tension in the world of creativity ([Austin Kleons writes and talks alot about this](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/the-creative-tensions)). The push and pull of things. It's easy not to feel like A Runner because I don't run in the way a lot of elite or even hard core runners. But I also feel like A Runner because..well...I like getting out for runs.

I think interesting stuff lives in the inbetween of that tension. In this case the space inbetween being and not being a runner. There's a weird balance of looking at these elements and using them as motivation of wanting to get better while also balancing a feeling of good enough, because this is all supposed to be fun.

I think tensions are worth exploring in all aspects of life - and if you're also a runner/a fan of the Nike Run Club app let's just say this is about running and this is not about running.
